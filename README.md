# Crown Battles

This a simulation made for all possible gameplays in the board game Crown Battles.

It simulates the play of [2,3,4,5,6,7,8] players
for the below gameplays for each player:

num_cards_for_the_round_dict[2] = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]   # 2-players

num_cards_for_the_round_dict[3] = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]   # 3-players

num_cards_for_the_round_dict[4] = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]          # 4-players

num_cards_for_the_round_dict[5] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]  # 5-players

num_cards_for_the_round_dict[6] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]        # 6-players

num_cards_for_the_round_dict[7] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]             # 7-players

num_cards_for_the_round_dict[8] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]               # 8-players


The current **target** is set for the player to make [0,1,2,3,4] tricks in a game. However, it was tested for all the possible missions.

The program gives the possibility of achieving the **target** outcome for all the possible gameplays mentioned above.
